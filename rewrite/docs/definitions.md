### Definitions:

"Contract" is ambiguous - these terms are preferred:

**class**: A Solidity "contract" definition (potentially any named bit of code that can be deployed) - a name used during compilation

**object**: A specific contract instance that has been deployed and has an address.

**chain context**: A set of named addresses (possibly null/undefined) for a given blockchain.

**contract sources**: A set of Solidity source files.

**package**: collection of contract sources with a chain context, name, version, and list of dependencies.

**bound package**: A package with all named addresses defined.

**unbound package**: A package with at least one undefined named address.

**staged package**: A package whose chain context can be modified.

**deploy step**: An instruction that makes a change to a staged package AND/OR the global network state

    * pending: dapple sent a transaction, but has not confirmed the action
    * complete: dapple has confirmed that the transaction had the intended effect and is permanent

**deploy script**: A sequence of deploy steps associated with a particular package. 

**complete package**: A package that can be bound with the result of the deploy script of a collection of some dependent package

**system instance**: The set of objects named by the chain context of a deployed system type.


A package will typically ship a dev deploy sequence which will create a chain context which mocks the
one deployed on Ethereum.
